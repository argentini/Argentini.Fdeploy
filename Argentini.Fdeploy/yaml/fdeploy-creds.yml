# Fdeploy Credentials Reference Configuration
# ===========================================
# This file must be the same as its configuration file (e.g. `fdeploy-staging.yml`),
# but with `-creds` appended (e.g. `fdeploy-staging-creds.yml`).
# A file named `fdeploy-creds.yml` will be used for all configuration files in the project folder.
